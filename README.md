# fashionMNIST
Here I use a neural network to label images correctly from the fashion
MNIST dataset.

Accuracy on validation set is ~79%, although I haven't adjusted any 
hyperparams yet so it will be similar for the test set.

I import the fashion MNIST dataset using tensorflow, and
only use numpy and my own methods for everything.

This is part of my final year project at university. 
later dataset might be CIFAR-10.
